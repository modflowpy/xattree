- support slotted attrs classes? need to rethink init approach, currently just steals from and prunes `__dict__`
    - necessary tho? realistic for model to have >thousands of packages? probably not..
    - if so, will attrs-generated `__getstate__`/`__setstate__` work?
- integrate with custom coordinate transform / range index?

- do we need any hooks? e.g. `__xattree_post_init__`?
- cache accessors at decoration time for faster `__getattr__` at runtime
- run converters/validators in `__setattr__` override
